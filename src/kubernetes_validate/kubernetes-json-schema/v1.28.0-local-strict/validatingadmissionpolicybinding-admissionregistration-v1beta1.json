  "description": "ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding binds the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy with paramerized resources. ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding and parameter CRDs together define how cluster administrators configure policies for clusters.\n\nFor a given admission request, each binding will cause its policy to be evaluated N times, where N is 1 for policies/bindings that don't use params, otherwise N is the number of parameters selected by the binding.\n\nThe CEL expressions of a policy must have a computed CEL cost below the maximum CEL budget. Each evaluation of the policy is given an independent CEL cost budget. Adding/removing policies, bindings, or params can not affect whether a given (policy, binding, param) combination is within its own CEL budget.",
