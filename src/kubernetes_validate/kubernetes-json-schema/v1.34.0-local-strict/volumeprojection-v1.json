Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated. The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet may change the order over time."

Once the signer approves the request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume source in its spec.\n\nKubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt timestamp.\n\nKubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and certificateChainPath fields.\n\nThe credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically, signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).\n\nPrefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath, your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are consistent.\n\nThe named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to use the certificates it issues."
