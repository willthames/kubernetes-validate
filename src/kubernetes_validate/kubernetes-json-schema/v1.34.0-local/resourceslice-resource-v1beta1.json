  "description": "ResourceSlice represents one or more resources in a pool of similar resources, managed by a common driver. A pool may span more than one ResourceSlice, and exactly how many ResourceSlices comprise a pool is determined by the driver.\n\nAt the moment, the only supported resources are devices with attributes and capacities. Each device in a given pool, regardless of how many ResourceSlices, must have a unique name. The ResourceSlice in which a device gets published may change over time. The unique identifier for a device is the tuple <driver name>, <pool name>, <device name>.\n\nWhenever a driver needs to update a pool, it increments the pool.Spec.Pool.Generation number and updates all ResourceSlices with that new number and new resource definitions. A consumer must only use ResourceSlices with the highest generation number and ignore all others.\n\nWhen allocating all resources in a pool matching certain criteria or when looking for the best solution among several different alternatives, a consumer should check the number of ResourceSlices in a pool (included in each ResourceSlice) to determine whether its view of a pool is complete and if not, should wait until the driver has completed updating the pool.\n\nFor resources that are not local to a node, the node name is not set. Instead, the driver may use a node selector to specify where the devices are available.\n\nThis is an alpha type and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate.",
