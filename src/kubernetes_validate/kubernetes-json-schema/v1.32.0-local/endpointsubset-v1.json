  "description": "EndpointSubset is a group of addresses with a common set of ports. The expanded set of endpoints is the Cartesian product of Addresses x Ports. For example, given:\n\n\t{\n\t  Addresses: [{\"ip\": \"10.10.1.1\"}, {\"ip\": \"10.10.2.2\"}],\n\t  Ports:     [{\"name\": \"a\", \"port\": 8675}, {\"name\": \"b\", \"port\": 309}]\n\t}\n\nThe resulting set of endpoints can be viewed as:\n\n\ta: [ 10.10.1.1:8675, 10.10.2.2:8675 ],\n\tb: [ 10.10.1.1:309, 10.10.2.2:309 ]",
