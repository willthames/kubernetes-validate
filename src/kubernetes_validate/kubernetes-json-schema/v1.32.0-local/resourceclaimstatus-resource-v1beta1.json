When they reference the same ResourceClaim which already has reached its maximum number of consumers, only one pod can be scheduled.\n\nBoth schedulers try to add their pod to the claim.status.reservedFor field, but only the update that reaches the API server first gets stored. The other one fails with an error and the scheduler which issued it knows that it must put the pod back into the queue, waiting for the ResourceClaim to become usable again.\n\nThere can be at most 32 such reservations. This may get increased in the future, but not reduced.",
